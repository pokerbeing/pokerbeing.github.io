Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a personal website consisting of a homepage and 5 supporting pages that each represent a different personal interest of mine.  

I used a foundation of bootstrap.css and their corresponding javascript and popper libraries.

Some key features I utilized were containers, grid formatting in two columns(principally for putting multiple elements of the same row), navbar (for a collapsible navigation bar) that toogles between mobile or full-screen PC modes.  This collapsible content is in fact a unordered list.

CSS properties I used include: button, text-center, img-responsive, navbar-toggler,
nav-item, device-width, col-xs-12, nav-link.

On the poker.html page, I used the class selector .table-striped to modify the background color of every other row intable. 

I used an id="navbarSupportedContent" as part of the collapsible navigation bar.
